## Python-Pandas-Project
### Retail Sales Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores a retail sales dataset using Python to uncover insights into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends. The analysis focuses on understanding how different factors such as product category, customer demographics, delivery time, and payment methods influence sales outcomes.

The project follows a structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow, starting from data loading and cleaning, moving through univariate and bivariate analysis, and concluding with business-focused insights and recommendations. Visualizations are used throughout to clearly communicate findings and support data-driven decision-making.

### Key Highlights:

-Performed data cleaning and feature engineering (revenue and net revenue)
-Conducted univariate analysis to understand distributions and frequencies
-Performed bivariate analysis to compare customer behavior across categories, countries, and demographics
-Analyzed revenue performance by product category and market
-Derived actionable business insights and recommendations
