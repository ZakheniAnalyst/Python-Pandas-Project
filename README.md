## Python-Pandas-Project
### Retail Sales Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project explores a retail sales dataset using Python to uncover insights into customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends. The analysis focuses on understanding how different factors such as product category, customer demographics, delivery time, and payment methods influence sales outcomes.

The project follows a structured Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow, starting from data loading and cleaning, moving through univariate and bivariate analysis, and concluding with business-focused insights and recommendations. Visualizations are used throughout to clearly communicate findings and support data-driven decision-making.

### Key Highlights:
-Performed data cleaning and feature engineering (revenue and net revenue)
-Conducted univariate analysis to understand distributions and frequencies
-Performed bivariate analysis to compare customer behavior across categories, countries, and demographics
-Analyzed revenue performance by product category and market
-Derived actionable business insights and recommendations

### 📈 Bivariate Analysis
## Payment Method Usage / Distribution
### Insights:
Credit cards are the most frequently used payment method, followed by debit cards and PayPal. 
This indicates a strong preference for card-based payments, highlighting the importance of maintaining reliable
card payment infrastructure while offering alternative digital options.

## Gender Distribution
### Insight:
The customer base is evenly split between male and female customers, indicating balanced engagement across genders.
This suggests that current products and marketing efforts appeal equally to both segments, with no immediate gender bias in purchasing behavior.

### Tools & Technologies:
-Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
-Google Colab
-GitHub

### Outcome:
The analysis identifies top-performing product categories, preferred payment methods, key customer segments,
and the relationship between delivery speed and customer satisfaction. These insights can help retail stakeholders optimize pricing,
logistics, and marketing strategies.

### Key Insights
- Electronics and Home Appliances drive the majority of revenue
- Faster delivery correlates with higher customer satisfaction
- Discounts do not always translate into higher net revenue
- A small number of countries contribute most orders

  ### Business Recommendations
- Improve logistics for high-value product categories
- Focus marketing efforts on top-performing markets
- Apply targeted discounts instead of broad price reductions
